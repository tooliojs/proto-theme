## Getting Started

In order to use this theme, we need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
installed, as well as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). If you already have
those two installed, skip this page and continue to [Installation](Installation.html).



| Operating System | Recommended Method | Download |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Windows | download and run Windows Installer | [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) |
| Mac | download and run macOs Installer | [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) |
| Linux | build source files | [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) |

To make sure `Node` and `npm` are properly installed, run this in a command prompt:

```bash
node --version & npm --version
```

If you didn't get any errors,  you can proceed to [Installation](Installation.html).
