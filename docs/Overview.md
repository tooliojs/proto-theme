## Overview

*Note: This project is a theme for [@toolio/docs](https://github.com/tooliojs/docs).
The idea is to create "proper" documentation for your project as quick as 
possible. It uses [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org) to compile Markdown to 
HTML, then calls on the `theme` to build the distributable files. This is 
one of those themes.*

The reason it's called Proto is becauase this theme uses primitive web
technologies. HTML, CSS, JavaScript. No JavaScript framework.
There is however a few `.js` files already included that will be 
covered later in [Markdown](Markdown.html). If you would rather use
a theme that is built using a Js framework/library, check out "More Themes", 
or continue to [Getting Started](Getting%20Started.html).
