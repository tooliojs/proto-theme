## Markdown

This theme uses [Standard Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
There's no specifications or any custom configs given to Marked.js, but there is a couple of
JavaScript programs that enhance the final result of Markdown to HTML compilation.

### Code

An extensive syntax highlighting comes with this theme made possible by [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).
If you would like to use a different stylesheet for Highlight.js or if you want to use a different Syntax
Highlighting program, check out [Advanced](Advanced.html).

### Emojis

Who doesn't :heart: emojis? Better yet, :github: style emojis.
If your familiar with [Github's Emoji Markup](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)
you can get started by including the markup in your Markdown files.
Check out [Ezmoji](https://github.com/arakilian0/ezmoji) for more details.

### Icons

The icon library included with this theme is [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com).
Icons can be used in your Markdown files, or directly in the output HTML.
