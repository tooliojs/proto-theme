## Installation

If you already have a `Node` project set up and you want
to start documenting it, just skip to step 3.

1. First, open a command prompt and create a directory named whatever you want and navigate into it.
```bash
mkdir proto-test && cd proto-test
```

2. Before we begin developing and installing dependencies it's good to 
initialize your project with npm.
```bash
npm init -y
```

3. Make sure your in your projects root directory and run the following command.
```bash
npm install @toolio/docs @toolio/proto-theme --save-dev
```

If the dependencies were installed, you can proceed to [Build](Build.html).

### Report Issues

If you encountered an error, during the Installation process, please submit a 
[Bug Report](https://github.com/tooliojs/proto-theme/issues/new/choose). We
will try our best to fix the issue as quick as possible. On the other hand, 
the project is open source. You always have the option to clone it, and 
try and solve the issue yourself. We really appreciate all the help 
we can get :heart:
